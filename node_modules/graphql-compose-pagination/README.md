[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose-pagination/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Installation
============
```
npm install graphql graphql-compose graphql-compose-pagination --save
```

Modules `graphql` and `graphql-compose` are in `peerDependencies`, so should be installed explicitly in your app. They should not installed as submodules, cause internally checks the classes instances.


Example
=======
```js
import composeWithPagination from 'graphql-compose-pagination';
import userTypeComposer from './user.js';

composeWithPagination(userTypeComposer, {
  findResolverName: 'findMany',
  countResolverName: 'count',
});
```

Requirements
============
Types should have following resolvers:
* `count` - for records count
* `findMany` - for filtering records. Resolver `findMany` should have `limit` and `skip` args.

Used in plugins
===============
[graphql-compose-mongoose](https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose-mongoose) - converts mongoose models to graphql types
